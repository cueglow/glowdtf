# Module test

# Package org.cueglow.server.integration

This package contains tests that will each start a server instance and interact with its network API to test it. 

Other so called "integration tests" (i.e. testing multiple pieces of code interacting with each other) that don't 
start up a complete server instance are placed in other packages. 

This structure may need to be refactored once more code is added.
