## Branching Guide

We try to adhere to OneFlow Branching as described in https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow. To create a new feature, branch off from main with 

```
git checkout -b feature/my-feature main
```

and then once you want a review, open a pull request in GitHub.
